This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started (Groep 5)

#### HOW TO EDIT THE FRONTEND PAGE
You need:
Visual Studio 2022 (Or any version of Visual Studio)

Steps:
- Install [Next.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
IMPORTANT: During installation, you must make sure "Automatically install the necessary tools." is checked. ☑️
- Once everything is done (CMD en Powershell commands): Go to the [B2D_FrontEnd repository](https://github.com/ZuydUniversity/B2C6_B2D_Frontend/tree/groep_5_b2d?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Press the green "Code" button > Open with Visual Studio
- Copy the `.gitignore` file from the [Source Repository](https://github.com/ZuydUniversity/B2C6_B2D_Frontend) and paste the contents within the `.gitignore` file within your code workspace in Visual Studio.
- Commit this change by pressing Git > Commit or Stash in the top left of Visual Studio.
- Push the change to this branch.. It's possible an error regarding `FileContentIndex` is raised. To fix this, right click this folder under the Commit tab on the right, and click "Ignore these local files". Thenn try again. Once no errors are raised, click Fetch, then Pull. Now your code is synced.
- Right click the main folder in the Visual Studio project (B2C6_B2D_Frontend), and click "Open in Terminal"
- type "npm install" and press enter, wait till everything is installed.
- type "npm run dev" and press enter, this should start running the server locally.
- Wait for a bit, then open this [link](http://localhost:3000), you should now see the page!

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
